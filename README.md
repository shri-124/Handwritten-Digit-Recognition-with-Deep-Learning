# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning
Built and trained a PyTorch CNN achieving 98.6% accuracy on the MNIST dataset (10,000 test images). Leveraged data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and model serialization. Evaluated performance using a confusion matrix and per-class metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) in R, and visualized results in Tableau.
